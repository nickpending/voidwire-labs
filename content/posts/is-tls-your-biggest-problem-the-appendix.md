This technical analysis serves as a companion piece to our main article ["Is TLS Your Biggest Problem?"](https://labs.voidwire.info/posts/is-tls-your-biggest-problem/) While the main article examines the broader implications of TLS protocol security, these appendices provide exhaustive technical details across four critical areas: network position prerequisites, browser/library implementation timelines, network position analysis, and comprehensive CVE analysis.

For security practitioners and technical teams, these appendices offer the detailed technical foundation underlying the main article's conclusions. By examining the specific technical requirements, historical implementation details, and practical attack considerations, we demonstrate why theoretical vulnerabilities often face significant practical exploitation barriers.
