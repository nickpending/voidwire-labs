Welcome to my new blog.

## What to Expect
I'll be using this space to share:
* Security tools I build
* Analysis of interesting security problems
* Data-driven observations
* Technical experiments and results
* Random thoughts about security issues I encounter

The focus will be primarily technical content, though I may occasionally venture into other topics that catch my interest.

## Coming Soon
My next post will challenge the fundamental logic of vulnerability scanning and present a new paradigm for modern security. Stay tuned!
