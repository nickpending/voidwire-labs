Built a tool called censyspy that simplifies FQDN discovery via Censys. While you can absolutely do all of this with the Censys CLI and their query syntax (which isn't particularly complex), this wrapper makes it a bit more straightforward if you're specifically hunting for FQDNs. Since Censys has such a massive certificate dataset, queries can take a few minutes to complete - the tool defaults to a 5-minute timeout which should be enough for most cases.

## What's it actually do?

censyspy leverages Censys's comprehensive dataset to discover FQDNs in two ways:

1. DNS Records: Finding FQDNs through both forward and reverse DNS lookups
2. SSL/TLS Certificates: Identifying additional FQDNs from certificate Subject Alternative Names (SANs)

The tool can combine these data sources to provide a more complete picture of your targets. There is a `--days` feature so you can sortakinda get at *"what's new"* data. It's not perfect, but it's workable given the API limitations. *Note: The API isn't limited, Censys just doesn't expose a `first_seen` parameter for us to use.*

## Use

Basic usage is straightforward:

```bash
# Initial data grab
censyspy --data-type both --domain example.com --output initial_scan.json --days all

# Daily updates (catches both new and current assets)
censyspy --data-type both --domain example.com --output daily_scan.json --days 1
```

## Processing the data

Processing the results for actual security work is pretty simple:

```bash
# Get a clean list of FQDNs
cat results.json | jq -r 'keys[] as $top | .[$top] | keys[]' | sort -u > fqdns.txt
```

## Using your data

Once you have your list of fqdns you can feed that into your favorite tool. A few tools I'll use:
- httpx
- tlsx
- uncover
- ffuf
- xh
- httprobe

## HTTP Discovery

I typically pipe the output straight into httpx for an initial survey. It'll probe for HTTP/HTTPS services across a bunch of common ports, grab response headers, titles, and server info. Particularly useful for spotting vhosts and getting a feel for what's running where:

```bash
# Hunt for services with httpx
cat fqdns.txt | httpx -irh -bp -td -title -vhost -fhr -td -csp-probe -sc -server \
-ports http:80,8080,8081,8082,8088,https:443,4443,6443,7443,8089,8443,8449,8905,8910,9443
```

## TLS Analysis

For TLS analysis, here's an example using tlsx to check for hosts that might be vulnerable to FREAK by testing for export ciphers:

```bash
# Check for weak TLS configs with tlsx
cat fqdns.txt | tlsx -ci TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5,TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5,\
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA,TLS_DH_ANON_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5,\
TLS_DH_ANON_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA,TLS_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_SHA,\
TLS_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5,TLS_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5,\
TLS_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5,TLS_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_DES_CBC_40_SHA,\
TLS_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_DES_CBC_40_MD5 \
-c 5 -sm ztls -tps -tv -p 433 -cipher
```

Quick note: learned the hard way that you NEED to use `-sm ztls` when using `-ci`. If you don't, it defaults to auto and completely ignores your cipher list, which can be... frustrating to debug.

## Why bother saving the data?

This is where it gets good. Since Censys only shows you what's *active* at the time of probing, there's value in tracking what you find over time and maintaining your own dataset. Sure, you can fetch a current list of FQDNs straight from Censys and be done, but if you save this data it can be very useful in the future. 

1. You can generate wordlists based on actual naming patterns. Way more effective than generic subdomain lists when you're targeting specific organizations.
2. Spot DNS issues by comparing what you see now vs what you've seen before. These are easy to miss if you're only looking at current state.
3. Sometimes old assets stick around longer than they should. Historical data helps you find forgotten dev environments, test systems that never got cleaned up, or old API endpoints that might still be alive.
4. And more..

## Setting it up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickpending/censys-toolkit.git
cd censys-toolkit
pip install .
```

You'll need API creds from Censys (https://censys.io/api).

## What's next?

Working on:

- Better ways to analyze historical data
- More filtering options
- Maybe automate the processing of the json to produce lists?

## Where is it?

Code's up on [GitHub](https://github.com/nickpending/censys-toolkit) if you want to check it out or contribute.
